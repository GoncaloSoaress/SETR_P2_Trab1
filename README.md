This project aims to implement a FIFO with priority. In this type of FIFOs, instead of the element to be removed being the first to be inserted, the element to be removed corresponds to the element with the highest priority. The insertion of the element is done in an ordered manner according to its priority.
In this work, 3 files were developed: file that contains the header of the functions (fifo.h), the file that includes the content of the functions (fifo.c) and the main file (main.c) with the use and test of all developed functions.
