This project aims to implement a FIFO. A FIFO constitutes a data structure that organizes several data in the form of a queue and can be characterized in a policy in which the first element to enter the queue is the first to be removed. 
In this work, 3 files were developed: file that contains the header of the functions (fifo.h), the file that includes the content of the functions (fifo.c) and the main file (main.c) with the use and test of all developed functions.
